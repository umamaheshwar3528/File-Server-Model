Here we are giving an array as input for sorting and two numbers for addition operation for
Both synchronous and asynchronous operations using RCP’s call. Where in synchronous the
RCP is called by the client to server and waits for the result from server and displays it once
It gets that, whereas in asynchronous RCP’s request is sent from the client and it waits for acknowledgement from the server and sends back to the client
For Synchrous it is shown but for asynchronous it shows none because the server is waiting for an acknowledgement.
Once received it prints out the result
